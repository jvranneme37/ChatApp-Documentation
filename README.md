## 1. Project Overview

The project's primary goal is to establish a new office network and develop an internal text messaging application for a company expanding its business. The network design must be cost-effective and meet specific requirements for various sections of the building. The messaging app needs to be portable and function over the Internet on Windows devices.

## 2. Network Design

This section covers the design and implementation of the office network using Cisco Packet Tracer. The network must be robust, affordable, and segmented to ensure isolation between different sections.

* **Key Aspects:**
    * **Goals & Guidelines:** General principles for network design, including isolation, internet connectivity, printer access, cost optimization, and documentation requirements.
        * **Relevant Document:** `3.1. Packet Tracer goals and guidelines.pdf` 
    * **Building Layout & Requirements:** Detailed map of the office building and specific network needs for each area (offices, reception, machine room, open floor space), including device counts and bandwidth requirements.
        * **Relevant Document:** `3.2. Packet Tracer Building Layout and Network Requirements.pdf` 
    * **Tasks for Network Designers:** A comprehensive breakdown of tasks for the network design team, covering requirements analysis, topology design (VLANs, IP addressing), Packet Tracer implementation, security, remote access, budgeting, and final documentation.

## 3. Messaging Application Development

This section focuses on the development of a portable text messaging application for internal communication within the organization. The app must run on Windows and support individual and group messaging over the Internet.

* **Tasks for App Developers:** Detailed responsibilities for the app development team, including tech stack selection, core feature definition (GUI, networking, security), development phases, testing (portability, functionality, edge cases), and documentation (user guide, developer notes).
